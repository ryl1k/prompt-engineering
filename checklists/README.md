# Checklists

This folder contains review checklists for prompt-based systems.

These are not “how to write prompts”.  
They are audits for why prompts drift, break, or become unstable.

## How to use

Use this checklist when:

- behavior becomes inconsistent
- language drifts
- memory stops working
- format collapses
- adding rules makes things worse

Most fixes come from:
simplification, not optimization.

## Mental model

Prompts are not programs.

They are workloads applied to a stochastic system.

Checklists exist to catch:
- overload
- dominance conflicts
- bad placement
- unsafe assumptions
