# 13 — Human Illusion Traps

Most prompt engineering mistakes
are not technical.

They are psychological.

---

## The logic trap

"This makes sense, so it should work."

Models do not operate on sense.
They operate on statistics.

Logical structure does not imply
statistical dominance.

---

## The structure trap

"This is well organized."

Humans value structure.
Models value proximity.

Beautiful layouts often perform worse
than ugly ones.

---

## The explanation trap

"I explained it clearly."

Explanation helps humans.
Models do not gain understanding.

They gain patterns.

---

## The importance trap

"This rule is important."

Importance is not a signal to a model.

Only placement and frequency are.

---

## The verbosity trap

"More detail = better control."

More detail usually means:
more noise,
more conflicts,
more drift.

---

## The fairness trap

"I gave all rules equal priority."

Models do not respect fairness.
They pick winners.

---

## The empathy trap

"The model should understand my intent."

There is no intent.
Only token distributions.

---

## Why these traps persist

Because humans are trained to think:

- meaning first
- structure first
- intention first

Models operate on:

- recency
- frequency
- pattern continuation

These worldviews are incompatible.

---

## Mental model to keep

If something feels "obvious" to you,
it is probably invisible to the model.
