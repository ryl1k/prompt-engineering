# Anti-Patterns in Prompt Engineering

This section documents systematic failure modes in prompt engineering.

Not mistakes.
Not edge cases.

But patterns that:

* look reasonable,
* feel logical,
* and consistently break systems.

These are not “things to avoid”.
These are things people naturally do, and only later realize why everything drifted.
