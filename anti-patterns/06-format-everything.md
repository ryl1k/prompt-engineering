## 6. Format Everything

### What it is

Forcing strict structure for all responses.

### Why people do it

Because structured output feels more controllable.

### What actually happens

Format pressure dominates reasoning.

The model optimizes for not breaking structure.

### Typical symptoms

* generic answers
* missing nuance
* template-like output

### Why intuition fails

Structure is not neutral.

It reshapes what the model can express.
